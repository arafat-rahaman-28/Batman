    <h1>Batman's Origin Story</h1>
    <p>
        Bruce Wayne was born into Gotham’s richest and most influential family. His parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne, were kind-hearted philanthropists who raised Bruce with strong morals. One night, when Bruce was just a young boy, his parents took him to the movies. On their walk home through Crime Alley, a mugger stopped them and demanded their money. Despite handing it over, the criminal shot both Thomas and Martha in front of Bruce. That moment shattered Bruce’s childhood and left him with a burning void of grief, trauma, and anger. The image of his parents’ murder haunted him for the rest of his life.

        After the tragedy, Bruce was raised by Alfred Pennyworth, the loyal family butler. As Bruce grew up, he became obsessed with understanding crime, justice, and fear. He traveled the world, mastering martial arts, criminology, disguise, and psychological warfare. He trained with monks, mercenaries, and detectives — learning how to fight, track, and survive. But he knew that fists alone wouldn’t be enough to clean up Gotham. He needed to become something greater, something terrifying — a symbol. One night, a bat flew through his window. That moment inspired him to become a creature of the night: Batman.

        Now, Bruce Wayne lives a double life. By day, he is a billionaire playboy and head of Wayne Enterprises. By night, he becomes the Dark Knight — a masked vigilante who strikes fear into Gotham’s criminals. Operating from the Batcave beneath Wayne Manor, he uses advanced technology, detective skills, and his own physical strength to protect the city. Batman swore an oath over his parents' graves: he would fight crime and corruption in Gotham so that no child would have to suffer what he did. He is not just a man — he is vengeance. He is Batman.
